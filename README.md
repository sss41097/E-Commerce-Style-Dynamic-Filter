Redux has been used for the state management. 9 products are loaded initially from a local json file and images are fetched from local image folder. 2 types of products are available, laptop and mobile. User can filter using category or by price range or by both. Sorting can be done anytime.
Filtering options triggers dispatch actions which changes the state of the variables of redux store. As soon as any filter is selected, products are filtered and displayed on the page.
